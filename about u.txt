I'm a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.cit.mak.ac.ug/">School of Computing &amp; Informatics Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.mak.ac.ug/">Makerere University</a>, Uganda. I'm also a Visiting Lecturer in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a>, UK. My research interests are in machine learning, computer vision and data mining, and particularly in the use of these in developing countries to solve problems in health, agriculture and resource allocation. For more information see the site of the <a href="http://www.cit.mak.ac.ug/cs/aigroup/index.html">Artificial Intelligence in the Developing World (AI-DEV)</a> group, which I coordinate.
